## Introduction

In this work, we propose a self-supervised MRI motion correction method that leverages motion-guided implicit neural representations to learn the motion patterns and correct the motion artifacts in MRI scans. The pre-trained klD-Net takes a motion-corrupted k-space
and outputs a motion mask, which is post-processed to yield a list of movement groups
indicated by the different colors in $S$ for better visualization. The number of movements
and corresponding lines guide the Motion INR and the Image INR. The Image INR
predicts the motion-free image and the Motion INR is used for guidance by optimizing
the forward motion yielding a motion-corrupted k-space. The discrepancy between the
motion-corrupted and the measured k-space is minimized using the data-consistency
(DC) loss. The gradient entropy is a denoiser on the Image-INR output to impose crisp
image priors. The final motion-corrected image is the output of the Image INR.

## Example Results

We assess the Image quality of the motion correction compared to state-of-the-art methods for two motion scenarios.
